### For Developers

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mannie-exe/layer_1.git
cd layer_1

# Build modpack file (for distribution)
./make.sh mrpack

# Build instance zip (includes custom icon + bootstrapper)
./make.sh instance

# Build everything for release
./make.sh all
```

## Build System

layer_1 uses a streamlined build system built on top of [packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz):

- **`make.sh`** - Main build script with multiple targets
- **`pack.sh`** - Quick pack export script  
- **Automated CI/CD** - GitHub Actions handle releases
- **Clean separation** - All build artifacts organized in `dist/`

### Primary Build Targets

- **`mrpack`** - Create Modrinth-compatible modpack file
- **`instance`** - Build launcher instance with custom icon and bootstrapper
- **`clean`** - Clean build directories
- **`all`** - Build both mrpack and instance for release

### Distribution Flow

```bash
./make.sh mrpack     # ‚Üí dist/layer_1-v0.4.0-alpha.mrpack
./make.sh instance   # ‚Üí dist/layer_1-v0.4.0-alpha.zip
```

The instance build automatically includes the packwiz bootstrapper, allowing for one-click mod installation while preserving custom icons and configs.
